## [Cline](./cline.md)

Cline is a lightweight command-line interface tool designed to simplify prompt management and execution. It is ideal for developers and teams looking to streamline their workflows.

I made an improved version of Cline based on the default [suggestion](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/docs/prompting/custom%20instructions%20library/cline-memory-bank.md), enhancing its usability and adding new features to better suit various use cases.
